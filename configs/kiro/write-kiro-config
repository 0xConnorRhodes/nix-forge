Script Requirements:
- As a user, I want to maintain a user-editable list of Kiro extensions at the top of the file to specify which extensions should be installed.
- As a user, I want the script to install each extension in the list by running 'kiro --install-extension EXTENSION_NAME' for each item.
- As a user, I want to see success messages when extensions are installed successfully.
- As a user, I want to see error messages if extension installation fails or if the 'kiro' command is not found.
- As a user, I want to read a settings YAML file from '$HOME/code/nix-forge/configs/kiro/settings.yml'.
- As a user, I want to flatten the nested YAML structure into a single-level dictionary with dot-separated keys.
- As a user, I want to read a keybindings YAML file from '$HOME/code/nix-forge/configs/kiro/keybindings.yml'.
- As a user, I want to determine the correct output directory for 'Kiro' configuration based on my OS.
- As a user, I want the output directory to be '/Users/connor.rhodes/Library/Application Support/Kiro/User' if the platform is 'darwin'.
- As a user, I want the output directory to be '~/.config/Kiro/User' for all other platforms.
- As a user, I want to write the flattened settings data to 'settings.json' in the platform-specific config directory.
- As a user, I want to write the (non-flattened) keybindings data to 'keybindings.json' in the platform-specific config directory.
- As a user, I want the script to create the output directory if it doesn't exist.
- As a user, I want the script to print a success message to stdout when a file is written.
- As a user, I want the script to print errors to stderr if they occur.
